								<h2 class="major">Who are we?</h2>

								<p align="justify">Created on September 1, 2018, <b>DakarOxy</b> is a citizen-initiated project that stemmed from the desire to raise awareness and encourage the greening of urban neighborhoods in hope to counter the terrible effects of air pollution. Our objective? To help reforest Senegal, in the outskirts of the capital city and in the regions alike.</p>
								<p align="justify">As a small team who works with mostly personal funding and on the side of our professional activities, our reach remains humble, and the campaigns we run, modest. Nevertheless driven by strong patriotic sentiments, we believe in the value of every deed, big or small.</p>
								<p align="justify">Our hope to curb the ecological crisis due to global warming, leaving a cleaner earth for future generations, might be ambitious, but our strength lies in numbers: if we all work together, no challenge will be able to resist us.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Our Missions</h2>

								<p align="center"><strong>He who plants a tree, aware that he will never sit in its shade, <br />
									has at least begun to understand the meaning of life..</strong><br />
									-- Rabindranah Tagore.</p>

								<h3 class="major">PatriOxy</h3>
								<p align="justify">Since the beginning of its creation, DakarOxy's primary goal has been to encourage people to green their environment by helping them understand the vital role that trees play on our planet. Senegal has more sixteen million inhabitants, and if everyone were to do their part today, then our country would be over sixteen million trees richer, which would arguably help thwart the consequences of toxic greenhouse gases that threaten our health and that of the Earth.</p>

								<h3 class="major">Campaigns</h3>
								<p align="justify">Among <a href="#activities" class="dotted">DakarOxy's recurring activities</a>, we run reforestation campaigns in the most tree-depleted neighborhoods of the outskirts of our capital city, like in the regions outside of Dakar.</p>
								<p align="justify">These are carried out at the request and with the help of local populations after a <a href="#contract" class="dotted">contract of commitment</a> to protect and water the trees has been established between DakarOxy and the recipients of said trees. This is a requisite for any campaign to optimize the trees' chance of survival until they reach maturity and autonomy.</p>
								<p align="justify">Check out the work we do in the field on our <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dakaroxy/" target="_blank" class="dotted">Instagram</a> account and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2MtGhpl_nVGLFJlneOLBVA" target="_blank" class="dotted">YouTube</a> channel.</p>

								<h3 class="major">EcolOxy</h3>
								<p align="justify">As raising awareness is fundamental to help preserve the environment, one of DakarOxy's missions is to intervene directly within schools to educate our children to the problems that come with air pollution, including global warming. As adults of tomorrow, our children must be active today to help us solve a problem that concerns our generations as much as those to come.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Moral and Physical Contract</h2>

								<span id="intro">
									<p align="justify">Because we believe that people are the real motor of change, we try to do more than just plant trees: we meet those who benefit from our campaigns after they have submitted a request for help, and work with them to green their neighborhoods. A moral and physical contract is drawn to concretize the commitment of both parties.</p>
								</span>

								<span id="conditions">
									<h3 class="major">Conditions</h3>
									<p align="justify">Reforestation requests must meet a couple of prerequisites to be considered by the team:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>being an association or a group of people committed to monitoring and maintaining the trees</li>
										<li>making a request for a reforestation campaign by sending us a message on our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DakarOxy/" target="_blank">Facebook</a> page</li>
										<li>organizing a meeting where the trees will be planted</li>
									</ul>
								</span>

								<span id="commitmentDakarOxy">
									<h3 class="major">DakarOxy's Commitment</h3>

										<li>come by regularly, either during a planned visit or unannounced, until the trees have reached maturity, in order to check on their growth</li>
										<li>cover the campaign and its follow-ups</li>

								<span id="commitmentRecipients">
									<h3 class="major">Expectations for the Recipients</h3>

										<li>dig the holes for the trees at least 24 hours before the campaign</li>
										<li>ensure daily watering and the protection of the trees</li>
										<li>regularly ensure the trees are healthy</li>
