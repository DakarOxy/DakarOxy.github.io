								<h2 class="major">Who are we?</h2>

								<p align="justify">Founded on September 1, 2018, <b>DakarOxy</b> is a patriotic initiative that was created with the desire to awaken Senegalese minds and encourage the greening of our cities in hope to counter the terrible effects of air pollution. Our objective? To help reforest the country, in the outskirts of Dakar like in the regions.</p>
								<p align="justify">As a small team that works with mostly personal funding and on the side of our professional activities, our reach remains humble, and the <a href="#missions" class="link skew-forward-on-hover">campaigns</a> we run, modest. Nevertheless, driven by strong patriotic sentiments, we believe in the value of every deed, big or small.</p>
								<p align="justify">Hoping to curb the ecological crisis of global warming and leave a cleaner earth for future generations is certainly ambitious, but our strength lies in numbers. If we all work together, no challenge will be able to resist us.</p>

									<h3 class="major">The Team</h3>

								<h2 class="major">Our Missions</h2>

								<p align="center">« <strong>He who plants trees, aware that he will never sit in its shade, <br />
									has at least begun to understand the meaning of life..</strong> » <br />
									-- Rabindranah Tagore.</p>

								<h3 class="major">PatriOxy</h3>
								<p align="justify">Since the beginning of its creation, DakarOxy's primary goal has been to encourage people to green their neighborhood by helping them understand the vital role that trees play. Senegal has more sixteen million inhabitants, and if everyone were to do their share today, then our country would over sixteen million trees richer, which would arguably help thwart the consequences of the toxic greenhouse gases that threaten our health and the Earth.</p>
								<p align="justify">People of Senegal, join us in the fight against this ecological crisis whose scope goes well beyond borders.</p>

								<h3 class="major">Campaigns</h3>
								<p align="justify">Among DakarOxy's recurring activities, we run reforestation campaigns in the most tree-depleted neighborhoods in the outskirts of Dakar, as well as in the regions.</p>
								<p align="justify">These are carried out following the request and with the help of local populations after a <a href="#contract">contract</a> of commitment to protect and water the trees has been established between DakarOxy and the beneficiaries. This is a sine qua non condition for any campaign to optimize the trees' chances of survival while they reach maturity and autonomy.</p>
								<p align="justify">Check out the work we do in the field on our <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dakaroxy/" target="_blank">Instagram</a> account and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2MtGhpl_nVGLFJlneOLBVA" target="_blank">YouTube</a> channel.</p>

								<h3 class="major">EcolOxy</h3>
								<p align="justify">As bringing awareness to the youth is fundamental to help them preserve their environment, one of DakarOxy's mission is to intervene directly within schools to sensitize our children to the problems that come with air pollution, including global warming. As adults of tomorrow, our children must be active today to help us solve a problem that concerns our generations as much as those to come.</p>

						<!-- CONTRAT -->
							<article id="contrat">
								<h2 class="major">Moral and Physical Contract</h2>

								<span id="intro">
									<p align="justify">Because we are convinced of the importance of patriotic initiatives, we try to do more than just plant trees: we meet the people who benefit from our campaigns after they have submitted a request, and work with them to green their neighborhoods. A moral and physical contract is drawn to concretize the commitment of both parties.</p>
								</span>

								<span id="conditions">
									<h3 class="major">Conditions</h3>
									<p align="justify">Reforestation requests must meet a couple of prerequisites to be considered by the team:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>being an association or a group of people committed to monitoring and maintaining the trees</li>
										<li>making a request for a reforestation campaign by sending us a message on our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DakarOxy/" target="_blank">Facebook</a> page</li>
										<li>organizing a meeting where the trees will be planted</li>
									</ul>
								</span>

								<span id="engagement DakarOxy">
									<h3 class="major">DakarOxy's Commitment</h3>
									<p align="justify">If the request is approved by the team, DakarOxy then agrees to:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>provide trees, fencing, fertilizer</li>
										<li>come by regularly, either during a planned visit or unannounced, until the trees are autonomous, in order to evaluate their good development</li>
										<li>cover the campaign and its follow-ups</li>
									</ul>
								</span>

								<span id="engagement Bénéficiaires">
									<h3 class="major">The Commitment of the Beneficiaries</h3>
									<p align="justify">In return, the beneficiaries of the campaign must commit to:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>establish a list of recipients who will contribute to the tree with the symbolic sum of 500 FCFA (0.76€) per registered person</li>
										<li>dig the holes for the trees at least 24 hours before the campaign</li>
										<li>ensure daily watering and the protection of the trees</li>
										<li>regularly check the health of the trees</li>
										<li>designate a liaison agent who will periodically report to DakarOxy on the progress of the trees, with the help of pictures</li>
										<li>replace the tree in case of disappearance</li>
